# NTAG424 EV2 cryptography example

* `AuthenticateEV2` class to perform authentication with PICC
* `CryptoComm` class to sign/encrypt APDUs and validate responses.

This code was written according to the publicly available application note *AN12196 "NTAG 424 DNA and NTAG 424 DNA TagTamper features and hints"*. Pull requests welcome.

## Usage
Please refer to `test_ev2.py` and cross-check it with the application notes. There are also some docstrings in the `ev2.py` file.

* `AuthenticateEV2` - helper for performing `AuthenticateEV2First` handshake with PICC:
  * `init` - generate the initial APDU to start authentication;
  * `part1` - generate a response to first R-APDU from PICC;
  * `part2` - verify second R-APDU from PICC, initialize authenticated session;
* `CryptoComm` - a class which represents "authenticated session":
  * `sign_apdu` - convert `CommMode.PLAIN` APDU into `CommMode.MAC`;
  * `encrypt_apdu` - convert `CommMode.PLAIN` APDU into `CommMode.FULL`;
  * `validate_response` - parse R-APDU and verify it's MAC signature (`CommMode.MAC` response);
  * `decrypt_response` - decrypt the response data parsed by `validate_response` (`CommMode.FULL` response);
